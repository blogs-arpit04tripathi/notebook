title: Collection Interface
permalink: /java/collections/collection-interface
---

* Collection extends the **Iterable** interface hence can be cycled through using foreach style **for loop**.
* Collections ***can be modifiable and unmodifiable***, based on optional methods to do modification. Built-in collections are modifiable.
* Collections are made up of `(collection interfaces) + (Comparator, RandomAccess, Iterator, ListIterator and Spliterator interfaces)`.
