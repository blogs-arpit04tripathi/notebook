* **Daemon thread** in java is a service provider thread that provides services to the user thread. 
* It is a low priority thread.
* Its life depend on the mercy of user threads i.e. ***when all the user threads dies, JVM terminates this thread automatically***. 
* There are many java daemon threads running automatically e.g. gc, finalizer etc. 
* You can see all the detail by typing the jconsole in the command prompt. The jconsole tool provides information about the loaded classes, memory usage, running threads etc.

public void setDaemon(boolean status)|used to mark the current thread as daemon thread or user thread.
public boolean isDaemon()|used to check that current is daemon.

* To make a user thread as Daemon, it must not be started otherwise it will throw **IllegalThreadStateException**. 

```java
t1.start();
t1.setDaemon(true);    //will throw exception here  
```
