title: Method References
permalink: /java8/method-references
---

* Used for referencing a method without invoking it ie. for treating methods as Lambda Expressions. 
* They only work as syntactic sugar to reduce the verbosity of some lambdas.
* a double colon separating a class or object name and the name of the method.Â 

```java
(o) -> o.toString(); // === Object::toString();
p -> System.out.println(p); // === System.out::println

// Method Reference can be used in below example case
() -> method()
p -> method(p)
```
