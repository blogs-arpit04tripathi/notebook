1.	**Read Only**: This caching strategy should be used for persistent objects that will always read but never updated. It’s good for reading and caching application configuration and other static data that are never updated. This is the simplest strategy with best performance because there is no overload to check if the object is updated in database or not.
2.	**Read Write**: It’s good for persistent objects that can be updated by the hibernate application. However if the data is updated either through backend or other applications, then there is no way hibernate will know about it and data might be stale. So while using this strategy, make sure you are using Hibernate API for updating the data.
3.	**Nonrestricted Read Write**: If the application only occasionally needs to update data and strict transaction isolation is not required, a nonstrict-read-write cache might be appropriate.
4.	**Transactional**: The transactional cache strategy provides support for fully transactional cache providers such as JBoss TreeCache. Such a cache can only be used in a JTA environment and you must specify hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class.
