title: Using Disjunction Objects with Criteria
permalink: /hibernate/hql/criteria/disjoint

To create an OR expression with more than two different criteria.
The disjunction is more convenient than building a tree of OR expressions in code. To represent an AND expression with more than two criteria, you can use the conjunction() method, although you can easily just add those to the Criteria object. The conjunction can be more convenient than building a tree of AND expressions in code. 

```java
Criteria crit = session.createCriteria(Product.class);
Criterion priceLessThan = Restrictions.lt("price", 10.0);
Criterion mouse = Restrictions.ilike("description", "mouse", MatchMode.ANYWHERE);
Criterion browser = Restrictions.ilike("description", "browser", MatchMode.ANYWHERE);
Disjunction disjunction = Restrictions.disjunction();
disjunction.add(priceLessThan);
disjunction.add(mouse);
disjunction.add(browser);
crit.add(disjunction);
List results = crit.list();
```
