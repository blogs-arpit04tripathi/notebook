title: Association managed by both entities
permalink: /hibernate/associations/both-entities
---


```java
//Inside EmployeeEntity.java
@OneToOne
AccountEntity account;
 
//Inside AccountEntity.java
@OneToOne
EmployeeEntity employee;

//acc.setEmployee(emp);
sessionOne.save(emp);
EmployeeEntity employee = (EmployeeEntity) sessionTwo.get(EmployeeEntity.class, genEmpId);
account.getEmployee().getEmployeeId()  
// throws null pointer exception
```

With above association, both ends are managing the association so both must be updated with information of each other using setter methods defined in entity java files. If you fail to do so, you will not be able to fetch the associated entity information and it will be returned as null.

            left outer join Employee employeeen2_ on accountent1_.employee_ID=employeeen2_.ID where employeeen0_.ID=?
```

Both tables have foreign key association with column names **employee_ID** and **account_ID** respectively. Itâ€™s example of **circular dependency** in data and can easily bring down your application any time.

To correctly store above relationship, you must un-comment the line "acc.setEmployee(emp);". After uncommenting the line, you will be able to store and retrieve the association as desired but still there is circular dependency.
