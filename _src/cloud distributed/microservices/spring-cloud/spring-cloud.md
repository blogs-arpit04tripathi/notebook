-	Spring Cloud, in microservices, is a system that provides integration with external systems. 
-	It is a short-lived framework that builds an application, fast. 
-	Being associated with the finite amount of data processing, it plays a very important role in microservice architectures.

For typical use cases, Spring Cloud provides the out of the box experiences and a sets of extensive features mentioned below:
-	Versioned and distributed configuration.
-	Discovery of service registration.
-	Service to service calls.
-	Routing.
-	Circuit breakers and load balancing.
-	Cluster state and leadership election.
-	Global locks and distributed messaging.

**What Are The Advantages Of Using Spring Cloud?**  
When developing distributed microservices with Spring Boot we face the following issues-
-	Complexity associated with distributed systems- This overhead includes network issues, Latency overhead, Bandwidth issues, security issues.
-	Service Discovery- Service discovery tools manage how processes and services in a cluster can find and talk to one another. It involves a directory of services, registering services in that directory, and then being able to lookup and connect to services in that directory.
-	Redundancy- Redundancy issues in distributed systems.
-	Loadbalancing- Load balancing improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives.
-	Performance issues- Performance issues due to various operational overheads.
-	Deployment complexities- Requirement of Devops skills.
