* By default, all newly created buckets are private.
* Can setup access control to buckets using
    - ***Bucket Policies - Applied at bucket level***
    - ***Access Control List - Applied at an object level***
* S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs, which log all the requests made to the S3 bucket. These logs can be written to another bucket.
