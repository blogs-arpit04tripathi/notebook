A web service enables communication among various applications by using open standards such as HTML, XML, WSDL, and SOAP.

A web service takes the help of
* XML to tag the data.
* SOAP to transfer a message.
* WSDL to describe the availability of service.

- Service Description is published in a directory by all the service providers.
  - Service description is written in a special language called WSDL (Industry accepted).
- Services talk to the directory using SOAP (Industry Standard).
- Consumer service reads the description from the WSDL directory and creates a corresponding request in XML.
