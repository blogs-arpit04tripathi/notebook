- Application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 
- foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
- URI (Uniform resource identifier) - string of characters used to identify a name or a resource
  - URN (Uniform resource name) - URI that uses the urn scheme and does not imply availability of the identified resource.
  - URL (Uniform resource locator)
- Both URN's (names) and URL's (locators) are URI's, and a particular URI may be a name and a locator at the same time.
