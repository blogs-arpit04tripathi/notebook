***Jenkins is a java application used for continuous integration and delivery.***

Shared repository is updated by developers and the build at end of day has failed due to the introduced bug. Jenkins will help to find what code caused the failure rather than the developer going through the logs.
- Mail sent – Build Triggered and completed
- Post Build Action – Automated Unit test, Acceptance test, performance test. Report is generated. If build succeed but code breaks something it can be troubleshooted.
