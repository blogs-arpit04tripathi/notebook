```java
your website domain = maven.apache.org      , commons.apache.org
your groupId should be = org.apache.maven   , org.apache.commons
// if the current project is a multiple module project, it should append a new identifier to the parent's groupId.
org.apache.maven, org.apache.maven.plugins, org.apache.maven.reporting
```
> `.com` is primarily used by for-profit businesses, while `.org` is largely used by nonprofit websites.
