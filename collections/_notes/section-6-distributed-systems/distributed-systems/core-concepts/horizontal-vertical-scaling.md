- In simple terms, to scale horizontally is adding more servers.
- To scale vertically is to increase the resources of the server ( RAM, CPU, storage, etc. ). 
- Example: Lets say you own a restaurant which is now exceeding its seating capacity. One way of accommodating more people ( scaling ) would be to add more and more chairs (scaling vertically). However since the space is limited, you wonâ€™t be able to add more chairs once the space is full. 
Another way of scaling would be to open new branches of the restaurant ( horizontal scaling ).
