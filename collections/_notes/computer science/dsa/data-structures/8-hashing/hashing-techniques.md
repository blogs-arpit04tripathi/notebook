1. **Static Hashing**
   - When data is fixed.
   - Set of keys is kept fixed and given in advance, and the number of primary pages in the directory are kept fixed.
   - example - character array
2. **Dynamic Hashing**
   - When the data is not fixed.
   - set of keys can change dynamically.
   - example - numberic array
