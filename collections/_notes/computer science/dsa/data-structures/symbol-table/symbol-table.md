- Real time examples for dictionaries
  - Spell checker
  - The data dictionary found in database management applications
  - Symbol tables generated by loaders, assemblers, and compilers
  - Routing tables in networking components (DNS lookup)
- In computer science, we use the term ‘symbol table’ rather than ‘dictionary’ when referring to the abstract data type (ADT).

**What are Symbol Tables?**
- data structure that associates a value with a key.
- It supports the following operations:
  - Search whether a particular name is in the table
  - Get the attributes of that name
  - Modify the attributes of that name
  - Insert a new name and its attributes
  - Delete a name and its attributes
- There are only three basic operations on symbol tables: searching, inserting, and deleting.
