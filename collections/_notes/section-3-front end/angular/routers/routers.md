* Routers and router outlet
* Route â€“ multiple path vars or query params
* define navigation paths among views ie. sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.
* maps URL-like paths to views instead of pages. 
* When a user performs an action, such as clicking a link, that would load a new page in the browser, the router intercepts the browser's behavior, and shows or hides view hierarchies.
* Router logs activity in the browser's history journal, so the back and forward buttons work as well.
* `router` can *lazy-load* the module on demand.
