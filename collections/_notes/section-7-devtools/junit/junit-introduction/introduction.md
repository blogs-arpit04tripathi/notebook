**Why write Tests**  
The point of writing automated tests is not so much to verify that the code works now, but to verify on an ongoing basis that it continues to work in the future.

**Why use testing Framework?**

**JUnit 4**
- 10 years old
- Not up to date with new testing patterns
- Not up to date with java language features
- Monolithic architecture
- Bugs and feature requests piled up

**JUnit 5**
* JUnit 5 aims to adapt java 8 style of coding and several other features as well.
* Java 8 is required to create and execute tests in JUnit 5 (though tests written with JUnit 3 or JUnit 4 can be exceued as well for backward compatibility).
