# Batch OS
- Jobs with similar needs batched together, run as a group.
- First come first served.

### Disadvantages
- Only after completion of job1, control is transferred to job2.
- Under-utilisation of resources.
- Lack of interaction between user and program.

# Multitasking OS
- Jobs should be executed in time sharing mode.
- Fixed time quantum to every job (Preemption).
