# Introduction to Trie
- Efficient information retrieval Data Structure.
- Storing keys in BST will take M * log N time
  - M - max string length, 
  - N - No. of keys
- Using trie, we can search the tree in O(M) but the penalty is on the storage requirement.

Memory requirement of trie = 26 * k * N
- k = length of key
- N = No. of keys

# Trie Operations
## Insert
## Search

## Delete
- During delete operation we delete the key in bottom up manner using recursion.
- Deletion should not affect the existing keys in trie.

Steps
- Unmark leaf node.
- delete free nodes.
- climb up till root node.

# Trie
- efficient DS for searching words in dictionaries, 
- search complexity with Trie is linear in terms of word (or key) length to be searched. 
- If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. 
- Using trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. So it is much faster than BST.
- Hashing also provides word search in O(n) time on average. But Trie has no collisions so worst case time complexity is O(n).
- **Prefix Search** - With Trie, find all words beginning with a prefix (not possible with Hashing).
- **Problem with Tries** - they require a lot of extra space. 
- also known as **radix tree or prefix tree**.

The Trie structure can be defined as follows :
```
struct trie_node{
    int value; /* Used to mark leaf nodes */
    trie_node_t *children[ALPHABET_SIZE];
};
```
The leaf nodes are in blue.

|Complexity||
|---|---|
Insert time   | O(M), M is the length of the string.
Search time   | O(M) 
Deletion time | O(M)
Space         | O(ALPHABET_SIZE * M * N) 

N is number of keys in trie, ALPHABET_SIZE is 26 if we are only considering upper case Latin characters.

#### Trie ExamplesÂ 
- for dictionaries prefix search capability, approximate matching algorithms, including those used in spell checking. 
- It is also used for searching Contact from Mobile Contact list OR Phone Directory.
