- Required root Dependency - Spring Reactive Web
- It comes with Spring WebFlux.

```java
WebClient.Builder builder = WebClient.builder();
Movie movie = builder.build()
    .get()
    .uri("http://localhost:8080/movie/108")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(Movie.class) // Mono - kind of Promise for this object, Async
    .block(); // Wait till container is filled with returned object
```
