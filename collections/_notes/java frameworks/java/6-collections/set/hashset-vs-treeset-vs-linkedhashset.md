```java
public TreeSet(Comparator c)
```

- `comparator.compare` method is preferred over `Comparable.compareTo()`

# Similarities between HashSet and TreeSet
* unique elements
* shallow clone
* not thread safe
* fail-fast iterators

# When to prefer TreeSet over HashSet?
* Sorted unique elements are required instead of unique elements.
  * Default - ascending order
* When one need to perform read/write operations frequently
* TreeSet has greater locality than HashSet.
* In case data needs to be read from hard drive than prefer TreeSet as it has greater locality than HashSet.
