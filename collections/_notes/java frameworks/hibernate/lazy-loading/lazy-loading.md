**Why we should not make Entity Class final?**  
Hibernate use proxy classes for lazy loading of data, only when it’s needed. This is done by extending the entity bean, if the entity bean will be final then lazy loading will not be possible, hence low performance.

**What is Hibernate Proxy and how it helps in lazy loading?**  
Hibernate uses proxy object to support lazy loading. Basically when you load data from tables, hibernate doesn’t load all the mapped objects. As soon as you reference a child or lookup object via getter methods, if the linked entity is not in the session cache, then the proxy code will go to the database and load the linked object. It uses javassist to effectively and dynamically generate sub-classed implementations of your entity objects.
