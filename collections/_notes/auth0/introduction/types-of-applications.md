- Regular Web App - 
	- Traditional web apps that perform most of their application logic on the server (such as Express.js or ASP.NET).
- Single-page app(SPA) - 
	- JavaScript apps that perform most of their user interface logic in a web browser, communicating with a web server primarily using APIs (such as AngularJS + Node.js or React).
- Native App - 
	- Mobile or Desktop apps that run natively in a device (such as iOS or Android).
- Machine-to-Machine - 
	- Non-interactive apps, such as command-line tools, daemons, IoT devices, or services running on your back-end. 
	- Typically, you use this option if you have a service that requires access to an API.
