- Web Server
	- serves static resource (has web container)
	- Works with HTTP (HttpRequest and HttpResponse)
- Application Server - Computing power
- API - Contract between source and target systems for what data will be in and the format of it.
- API is the contract and Server is the lower level mechanism to transmitting and collecting the data b/w two systems.
