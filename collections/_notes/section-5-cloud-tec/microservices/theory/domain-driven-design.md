**Define Domain Driven Design**  
The main focus is on the core domain logic. Complex designs are detected based on the domain’s model. This involves regular collaboration with domain experts to resolve issues related to the domain and improve the model of the application. While answering this microservices interview question, you will also need to mention the core fundamentals of DDD. They are:
-	DDD focuses mostly on domain logic and the domain itself.
-	Complex designs are completely based on the domain’s model.
-	To improve the design of the model and fix any emerging issues, DDD constantly works in collaboration with domain experts.

**Why there is a need for DDD (Domain Driven Design)?**  
A domain-driven design is necessary for the following reasons.
-	Maintainability and Testability
-	Reducing Complexity
-	Knowledge-Rich Designs
-	More focused on context
-	Following the ubiquitous language
-	Mapping with domains.
-	Bringing business and domains together.

**What Do You Mean by Bounded Context?**  
A central pattern is usually seen in domain driven design. Bounded context is the main focus of the strategic design section of DDD. It is all about dealing with large teams and models. DDD works with large models by disintegrating them into multiple bounded contexts. While it does that, it also explains the relationship between them explicitly.

**What Is Conway's Law?**
Conway’s Law states, “organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”

Now question is, how is Conway's Law related to microservices. Well, some loosely coupled APIs form the architecture of microservices. The structure is well suited to how a small team is implementing components which are autonomous. This architecture makes an organization much more flexible in restructuring its work process.

**How can you define the Ubiquitous Language for Microservices?**  
This is a specific language that can be used by developers or users to define every domain in detail. This is a crystal-clear language that brings all the team members together on the same page and translated so well that a machine can understand quickly.
