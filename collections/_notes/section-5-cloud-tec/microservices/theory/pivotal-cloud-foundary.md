**What is Pivotal Cloud Foundry(PCF)?**  
Some time back all the IT infrastructure was on premises. There we in house servers managed by an IT resource personnel or a service provider.

Then with advent of cloud services these software and hardware services are now delivered over the internet rather than being on premises.

Cloud Foundry is an open source, multi-cloud application platform as a service governed by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. The software was originally developed by VMware and then transferred to Pivotal Software, a joint venture by EMC, VMware and General Electric.

It is a service (PaaS) on which developers can build, deploy, run and scale applications.   
Many Organizations provide the cloud foundry platform separately. For example following are some cloud foundry providers-
-	Pivotal Cloud Foundry
-	IBM Bluemix
-	HPE Helion Stackato 4.0
-	Atos Canopy
-	CenturyLink App Fog
-	Huawei FusionStage
-	SAP Cloud Platform
-	Swisscom Application Cloud
