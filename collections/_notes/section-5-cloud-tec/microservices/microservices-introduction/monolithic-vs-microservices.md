- **Monolithic architecture** is like a big container in which all the software components of an application are clubbed inside a single package.
- **Microservice Architecture** is an architectural development style which builds an application as a collection of small autonomous services developed for a business domain.
  - large-scale websites : Twitter, Netflix, Amazon.

|Microservices|	Monolithic Architecture|
|---|---|	
|Service Startup is fast|	Service startup takes time|
|Loosely coupled architecture.|	Mostly tightly coupled.|
|Changes done in a single data model does not affect other Microservices.|	Any changes in the data model affect the entire database|
|Microservices  focuses  on products, not projects|	Monolithic put emphasize over the whole project|
