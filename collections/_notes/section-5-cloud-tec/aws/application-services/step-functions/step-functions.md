- Allows you to visualize and test your serverless applications using JSON-based Amazon States Language.
- Provides a graphical console to arrange and visualize the components of your applications as a series of steps. This makes it simple to build and run multi-step applications.
- Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries when there are errors, so your application executes in order and as expected.
- Step Functions logs the state of each step, so when things do go wrong, you can diagnose and debug problems quickly.
