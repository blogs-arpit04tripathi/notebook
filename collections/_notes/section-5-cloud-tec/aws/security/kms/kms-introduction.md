- KMS - Key Management System
- Managed service to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data
- Integrates with EBS, S3, RedShift, Elastic Transcoder, WorkMail, RDS etc.
- Encryption Keys are Regional.

It is a good practice to create 2 different users
- KMSManager - who creates and manages the key
- KMSEncryptor - who has the ability to encrypt and decrypt4
