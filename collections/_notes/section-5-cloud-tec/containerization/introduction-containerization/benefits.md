title: Benefits of Docker

The main advantages of Docker are:
-	**Application portability**: Docker containers run exactly the same on any Linux host. This eliminates the challenge of deploying applications across different compute infrastructure (e.g. local developer machine, VM, or in the cloud).
-	**Higher server density**: The lightweight nature of containers allows developers to optimize server utilization for their application workloads by running more containers on the same host while achieving the same isolation and resource allocation benefits of virtual machines.

**Docker CE vs. EE**  
Docker, Inc. provides two versions of its Docker project. Docker CE (Community Edition) is meant for developers who are experimenting with containers. They also provide the EE (Enterprise Edition), which is the supported and certified version.
Because Docker EE requires a subscription, this Refcard will use the Community Edition.
