# Major objectives of SOA
- To structure procedures or software components as loosely coupled services.
- To provide a mechanism for publishing available services, which includes their functionality and input/output (I/O) requirements.
- To control the use of these individual services to avoid security and governance problems.

# SOA Key principles
- Standardized service contract with all the description of the services.
- Loose coupling between the web services and the client.
- Service Abstraction rule, service should not expose the functionality implementation to client application.
- Services should be reusable in order to work with various application types.
- Services should be stateless having the feature of discoverability.
- Services break big problems into little problems and allow diverse subscribers to use the services.
