- Any service that is available over the Internet or private (intranet) networks.
- Uses open standards like **XML**(for data tagging), **SOAP**(for message transferring) and **WSDL**(to denote service availability).
- Is not tied to any one operating system or programming language.
- Is self-describing via a common XML grammar.
- Is discoverable via a simple find mechanism.
- Works on client server model where web services are easily accessible to client applications over the network.

**Advantages of web services?**
- **Interoperability** - By the help of web services, an application can communicate with other application developed in any language.
- **Reusability** - We can expose the web service so that other applications can use it.
