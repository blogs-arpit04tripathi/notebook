title: HQL Delete

DELETE removes the details of existing objects from the database. In-memory entities will not be updated to reflect changes resulting from DELETE statements. This also means that Hibernateâ€™s cascade rules will not be followed for deletions carried out using HQL. However, if you have specified cascading deletes at the database level (either directly or through Hibernate, using the @OnDelete annotation), the database will still remove the child rows.

```sql
DELETE
   [FROM] path [[AS] alias]
   [WHERE logicalExpression]
```
```java
Query query=session.createQuery("delete from Account where accountstatus=:status");
query.setString("status", "purged");
int rowsDeleted=query.executeUpdate();
```
