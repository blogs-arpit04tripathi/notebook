Now when we have understood the problem, letâ€™s understand how lazy loading actually helps in real life. If we consider to solve the problem discussed above then we would be accessing a category (or catalog) in below manner:

```java
//Following code loads only a single category from the database:
Category category = (Category)session.get(Category.class,new Integer(42));
```
However, **if all products of this category are accessed, and lazy loading is in effect, the products are pulled from the database as needed.** For instance, in the following snippet, the associated product objects will be loaded since it is explicitly referenced in second line.

```java
//Following code loads only a single category from the database
Category category = (Category)session.get(Category.class,new Integer(42));
//This code will fetch all products for category 42 from database - "NOW"
Set<Product> products = category.getProducts();
```
This solve our problem of loading the products only when they are needed.
