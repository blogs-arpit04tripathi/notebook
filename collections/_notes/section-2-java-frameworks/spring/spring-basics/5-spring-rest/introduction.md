- representation best suited for the client can be chosen using **ContentNegotiatingViewResolver**.
- **@RequestBody** along with HttpMethodConverter implementations
  - can convert inbound HTTP data into Java objects passed into controller handler methods.
- **@ResponseBody** along with HttpMethodConverter implementations.
  - bypass view-based rendering
