# Why do we need change to Java again?
* To Utilize Current Multi-Core CPUs Efficiently in order to develop Highly Concurrently and Highly Scalable applications.
* To Utilize Functional Programming Features

# How is Java 8 different from previous Java versions?
* **Lambda Expressions** − a new language feature allowing treating actions as objects
* **Method References** − enable defining Lambda Expressions by referring to methods directly using their names
* **Optional** − special wrapper class used for expressing optionality
* **Functional Interface** – an interface with maximum one abstract method, can be implemented using a Lambda Expression
* **Default methods** − give us the ability to add full implementations in interfaces besides abstract methods
* **Nashorn, JavaScript Engine** − Java-based engine for executing and evaluating JavaScript code
* **Stream API** − a special iterator class that allows processing collections of objects in a functional manner
* **Date and Time API** − an improved, immutable JodaTime-inspired Date API
* Spliterator
* Collections API Enhancements
* Concurrency Utils Enhancements
* Fork/Join Framework Enhancements
* Internal Iteration
* Parallel Array and Parallel Collection Operations
* Optional
* Type Annotations and Repeatable Annotations
* Method Parameter Reflection
* Base64 Encoding and Decoding
* IO and NIO2 Enhancements
* javac Enhancements
* JVM Changes
* Java 8 Compact Profiles: compact1,compact2,compact3
* JDBC 4.2
* JAXP 1.6
* Java DB 10.10
* Networking
* Security Changes

Along with these new features, lots of feature enhancements are done under-the-hood, at both compiler and JVM level.
