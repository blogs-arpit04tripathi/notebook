* ***call-by-value***
  * copies the value of an argument into the formal parameter.
  * Changes have no effect on the argument.
* ***call-by-reference***
  * a reference to an argument is passed. 
  * Changes made affects the actual argument.
* call-by-value and call-by-reference
	- primitive type ==> passed by value. 
	- object ==> effectively call-by-reference.
