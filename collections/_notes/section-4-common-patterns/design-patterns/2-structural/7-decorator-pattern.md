-	Decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime. 
-	At the same time other instances of the same class will not be affected by this, so individual object gets the modified behavior. 
-	Decorator design pattern uses abstract classes or interface with composition to implement.
-	We use inheritance or composition to extend the behavior of an object but this is done at compile time and its applicable to all the instances of the class. We can’t add any new functionality of remove any existing behavior at runtime – this is when Decorator pattern comes into picture.
-	Ex. In angular we have template that is changing at runtime with change in data.

# Example - Decorator Pattern
Suppose we want to implement different kinds of cars – we can create interface Car to define the assemble method and then we can have a Basic car, further more we can extend it to Sports car and Luxury Car. The implementation hierarchy will look like below image.

But if we want to get a car at runtime that has both the features of sports car and luxury car, then the implementation gets complex and if further more we want to specify which features should be added first, it gets even more complex. Now imagine if we have ten different kind of cars, the implementation logic using inheritance and composition will be impossible to manage. To solve this kind of programming situation, we apply decorator pattern in java.

# Components needed for implementation
- Component Interface
- Component Implementation
- Decorator
- Concrete Decorators 

### 1. Component Interface
interface or abstract class defining the methods that will be implemented.
```java
public interface Car { 	public void assemble(); }
```

### 2.	Component Implementation
The basic implementation of the component interface.
```java
public class BasicCar implements Car {
	@Override
	public void assemble() { System.out.print("Basic Car.");}
}
```

### 3.	Decorator
Decorator class implements the component interface and it has a HAS-A relationship with the component interface.  
The component variable should be accessible to the child decorator classes, so we will make this variable protected.
```java
public class CarDecorator implements Car {
	protected Car car;	
	public CarDecorator(Car c){	this.car=c;	}	
	@Override
	public void assemble() {this.car.assemble();	}
}
```

### 4. Concrete Decorators
Extending the base decorator functionality and modifying the component behavior accordingly. We can have concrete decorator classes as LuxuryCar and SportsCar.
```java
public class SportsCar extends CarDecorator {
	public SportsCar(Car c) {	super(c);	}
	@Override
	public void assemble(){
		super.assemble();
		System.out.print(" Adding features of Sports Car.");
	}
}

public class LuxuryCar extends CarDecorator {
	public LuxuryCar(Car c) {	super(c);	}
	@Override
	public void assemble(){
		super.assemble();
		System.out.print(" Adding features of Luxury Car.");
	}
}
```

- Client program can create different kinds of Object at runtime and they can specify the order of execution too.
```java
public class TestDecoratorPattern {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car sportsCar = new SportsCar(new BasicCar());
		sportsCar.assemble();
		System.out.println("\n*****");		
		Car sportsLuxuryCar = new SportsCar(new LuxuryCar(new BasicCar()));
		sportsLuxuryCar.assemble();
	}
}
```

# Decorator Design Pattern Important Points
-	Decorator design pattern is helpful in providing runtime modification abilities and hence more flexible. Its easy to maintain and extend when the number of choices are more.
-	The disadvantage of decorator design pattern is that it uses a lot of similar kind of objects (decorators).
- Decorator pattern is used a lot in Java IO classes, such as FileReader, BufferedReader etc.
