* Angular v1.x (AngularJS) - based on an MVC architecture.
* Angular 2 - based on a component/services architecture. 
* What happened to Angular v3? Skipped, to have consistent version numbering due to @angular/router version 4.

# Angular Enhancements
* Considerable improvements in bundle size as much as 60%.
* ngc, AOT compiler for angular and typescript are much faster.
* Compatible with latest version of typescript with better type checking and enhanced IDE features.
* IDE detect missing imports, removing unused declarations, unintentionally missing “this” operator etc.
