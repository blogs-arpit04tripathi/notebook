# ECMA Script 
* European Computer Manufacturers Association Script
* ECMAScript is object-oriented and conceived as a **core language** to which can be added the objects of any specific domain or context such as the idea of a "document." (for example, the World Wide Web Consortium's Document Object Model). 
* ECMAScript together with the Document Object Model corresponds closely to the current implementations of JavaScript and JScript. Although likely to be used mainly as a standard script language for the World Wide Web, ECMAScript could also be used for any scripted application.

# TypeScript
- Superset of js
- more features than plain vanilla js, eg. types, classes, interfaces
- used by developers for writing code, but eventually compiled to js for running.
