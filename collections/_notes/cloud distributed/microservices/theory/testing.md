**Explain three types of Tests for Microservices?**  
In Microservice architecture tests are divided into three broad categories:
-	At the bottom level test, we can perform a general test like performance and unit tests. These kinds of tests are entirely automated.
-	At the middle level, we can perform exploratory tests like the stress tests and usability tests.
-	At the top level, we can conduct acceptance tests which are mostly fewer in numbers. It also helps stakeholders to know about different software features.

**What Are Some Major Roadblocks for Microservices Testing?**  
Talking about the cons, here is another one of the microservices interview questions you may be ready for, will be around the [challenges faced while testing microservices](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/testing-challenges-related-to-microservice-architecture/).
-	Testers should have a thorough understanding of all the inbound and outbound processes before they start writing the test cases for integration testing.
-	When independent teams are working on different functionalities, collaboration can prove to be quite a struggling task. It can be tough to find an idle time-window to perform a complete round of [regression testing]( https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/regression-testing-strategies-of-mobile-web-pages/).
-	With an increasing number of microservices, the complexity of the system also increases.
-	During the transition from monolithic architecture, testers must ensure that there is no disruption between the internal communication among the components.

**How Would You Perform Security Testing on Microservices?**  
Before answering this microservices interview question, explain to the interviewer that microservices cannot be tested as a whole. You will need to test the pieces independently. There are three common procedures:
-	**Code scanning** – To ensure that any line of code is bug-free and can be replicated.
-	**Flexibility** – The security solution should be flexible so that it can be adjusted as per the requirements of the system.
-	**Adaptability** – The security protocols should be flexible and updated to cope up with the new threats by hackers or security breaches.
